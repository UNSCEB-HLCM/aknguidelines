>The parliamentary, normative and judicial documents published by the United Nations system of organizations, from now on “UN Documents”, are full of references to real-world objects and concepts, such as other documents, people, organizations, legal terms, and roles. Such entities are linked with the actual content of the document, even by means of different terms being the UN documents often issued in several official languages.</p

>Akoma Ntoso has defined a set of prescriptive / canonical classes and sub-classes modelled on the FRBR conceptualization of documents.</span
> These classes are referred via specific XML tags (prefixed by “FRBR”) in Akoma Ntoso documents. For <span
style="font-weight: bold;"
>non-document classes</span
> of parliamentary and legal matters, the Akoma Ntoso specifications do not define the ontology, as it could be overly wide and all-encompassing due to the very varied issues that legal and parliamentary documents deal with.   Akoma Ntoso only specifies a very broad set of general guidelines that an ontology should conform to. These informal guidelines are referred via specific XML tags (prefixed by “TLC”) in Akoma Ntoso documents, each referring to a particular informal top level class (TLC), we say informal because it is not defined by means of a formal language such as logics.</p

> (UNDO) is an OWL 2 DL ontology that aims to provide a framework for the formal description of all entities and the relations that can exist among them in UN Documents, a description that is not provided by Akoma Ntoso itself. The idea behind the development of this model is to have a mechanism for sharing data about documents and their content in RDF format and, eventually, extended by the various agencies of the United Nations to meet their own domain specific requirements.</p
