>The Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (<a
href="https://github.com/essepuntato/samod"
><span
class="c-Hyperlink"
>SAMOD</span
></a
>) is a novel agile methodology for the development of ontologies, partially inspired by the Test-Driven Development process in Software Engineering and by existing agile ontology development methodologies, such as eXtreme Design (XD). SAMOD is organised in three simple steps within an iterative process that focuses on creating well-developed and documented models. It uses exemplars of data, so as to produce ontologies that are always ready-to-be-used and easily-understandable by humans (i.e. the possible customers) without spending a lot of effort. It has been used to develop UNDO since the beginning. </p

><p
class="p-ListParagraph pn-4-0 n-4-0"
lang="en-US"
style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"
>The ontology engineer, with the help of domain experts, collects all the information about a specific domain, and builds a small monolithic model, called <span
style="font-style: italic;"
>modelet</span
>, formalizing the domain in consideration, following specific ontology development principles. Finally, a new <span
style="font-style: italic;"
>test case</span
> is created – i.e. a set of resources that includes the modelet, some <span
style="font-style: italic;"
>exemplar data</span
> and <span
style="font-style: italic;"
>query</span
> to be answered, that must be appropriately tested by means of formal tools, such as reasoners. If everything works fine, a milestone is released and the process continues, otherwise the ontology engineers have to go back to the previous milestone;</p
><p
class="p-ListParagraph pn-4-0 n-4-0"
lang="en-US"
style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"
>The ontology engineer merges the modelet of the new test case with the <span
style="font-style: italic;"
>current model</span
> produced by the end of the last iteration of the process, and consequently updates and checks all the test cases developed in the past so as to include the new current model. If everything works fine, a milestone is released and the process continues, otherwise the ontology engineer has to go back to the previous milestone;</p

class="p-ListParagraph pn-4-0 n-4-0"

>good practices</span
> for ontology development processes. If everything works fine, a milestone is released, otherwise the ontology engineer has to go back to the previous released milestone. Thus, in case there is another motivating scenario to be addressed, then the process is iterated, otherwise it stops.</p

>The Live OWL Documentation Environment (<a

><span
class="c-Hyperlink"
>LODE</span
></a
>) is a service that automatically extracts classes, object properties, data properties, named individuals, annotation properties, general axioms and namespace declarations from an OWL and OWL2 ontology, and renders them as ordered lists, together with their textual definitions, in a human-readable HTML page designed for browsing and navigation by means of embedded links. This LODE service is an open source development, and can be freely used. It may be used in conjunction with content negotiation to display this human-readable version of an OWL ontology when the user accesses the ontology using a web browser, or alternatively to deliver the OWL ontology itself when the user accesses the ontology using an ontology editing tool such as Protégé and NeOn Toolkit.</p

>The Graphical Framework for OWL Ontologies (<a

class="c-Hyperlink"
>Graffoo</span
></a
>), is an open source tool that can be used to present the classes, properties and restrictions within OWL ontologies, or sub-sections of them, as clear and easy-to-understand diagrams. The advantages of using such a Graffoo diagram are, thus, that it displays the logical relationships between elements of an ontology, or a sub-section of an ontology, in a manner that is relatively straightforward to understand, once one has grasped the meaning of the different elements of a Graffoo diagram. These elements are fully presented in the <a

><p
class="p-ListParagraph pn-5-0 n-5-0"
lang="en-US"
style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"
>global semantics (GS) is a characteristic of OWL ontologies (but not typically of E/R), and has the effect of unifying the formal interpretation of domain and range axioms, property characteristics, and all the restrictions that act at a global level. When GS does not hold, one is not allowed to assume such unification, even when the axioms regard two constants with the same name;</p
